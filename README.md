# Monotonic Polynomials with Random Effects in a Hierarchical structure.

This repo contains the R files and Stan model which should consitute a minimial working example.
_commentedExample.R_ is probably the file you are looking for (if for some reason you are indeed 
looking to fit such a model). 

Some day I may package this up, but that is currently not a priority.
